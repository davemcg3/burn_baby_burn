# Burn Baby Burn ðŸ”¥ Meeting Inferno

A meeting burn clock calculator / timer.

Made while _in a meeting_, modified while _in multiple other meetings_.

Visit https://davemcg3.github.io/burn_baby_burn/ for this version. Deployed with github pages. 

Notable changes from the original include a rewrite of the JavaScript structure, improvements to the mobile view so that it's usable on mobile, improvements (IMO) to the user interface while keeping consistent with the original theme, an improvement to break meetings into increments so that you can add and remove people from the meeting counter as they join and leave the meeting to get a more accurate cost, and an addition of using localStorage to store details on the latest few meetings. 

It's vanilla JavaScript so you just need a web server to use this locally.
